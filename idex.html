                <p><span class="highlight">Key Facts:</span>

                    Distance from the Sun: Approximately 2.87 billion kilometers (1.78 billion miles)
                    Orbital Period: 84.01 Earth years
                    Diameter: 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles)
                    Mass: Approximately 14.2 times the mass of Earth
                    Tilt: 97.77 degrees (nearly sideways)
                    Moons: At least 28 known moons
                    Rings: A system of faint rings</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Unique Features:</span>

                    Extreme Tilt: Uranus's axis is tilted at an angle of nearly 98 degrees, which means its poles are
                    located where most planets' equators are. This results in extreme seasonal variations.
                    Methane Atmosphere: Uranus's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The
                    methane gives the planet its distinctive blue-green color.
                    Internal Structure: Uranus is believed to have a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of icy materials
                    (water, methane, and ammonia) and an outer atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
                    Magnetic Field: Uranus has a weak magnetic field that is tilted at a significant angle to its axis
                    of rotation. This is unusual compared to other planets in the solar system.
                    Rings: Uranus's rings are faint and dark, and they are believed to be composed of icy particles.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Interesting Facts:</span>


                    Named after the Greek god of the sky: Uranus was named after the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.
                    Discovered by William Herschel: Uranus was discovered in 1781 by the astronomer William Herschel.
                    Voyager 2 Visit: In 1986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft made a close flyby of Uranus, providing valuable
                    data about the planet and its moons.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Moons:</span>

                    Uranus has at least 28 known moons, named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and
                    Alexander Pope.
                    Some of the most notable moons include:
                    Titania: The largest moon of Uranus, with a diameter of about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles).
                    Oberon: The second-largest moon of Uranus, with a diameter of about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles).
                    Miranda: A small moon with a highly unusual surface, featuring canyons, cliffs, and other strange
                    geological features.
                    Umbriel: A dark moon with a heavily cratered surface.
                    Ariel: A bright moon with a surface marked by craters and valleys.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Rings:</span>

                    Uranus has a system of faint rings, discovered in 1977.
                    The rings are believed to be composed of icy particles and are thought to be relatively young.
                    The rings are named after characters from Shakespeare's play "A Midsummer Night's Dream."</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Atmosphere:</span>

                    Uranus's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
                    The methane gives the planet its distinctive blue-green color.
                    Uranus's atmosphere is home to strong winds and storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a large storm
                    system that was observed in 1986.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Internal Structure:</span>

                    Uranus is believed to have a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of icy materials (water, methane, and
                    ammonia) and an outer atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
                    The planet's internal heat is relatively low, which is unusual for a giant planet.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Exploration:</span>

                    The only spacecraft to visit Uranus was Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1986.
                    Voyager 2 provided valuable data about Uranus's atmosphere, moons, rings, and magnetic field.
                    Future missions to Uranus could provide more detailed information about the planet and its moons.
